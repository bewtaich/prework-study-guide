        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML - Hypertext Markup Language</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title that is show to the user</li>
          <li>The style element defines the visual presentation using CSS</li>
          <li>The base element defines the URL for a webpage</li>
          <li>The link element defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, viewport, and description</li>
          <li>The script element embeds executable code within the document</li>
          <li>The h1 element defines a heading. h1 is the highest level of heading and h2, h3 etc. can be used to define lesser ones up to h6.</li>
          <li>The ul element defines an unordered list</li>
          <li>The ol element defines an ordered list</li>
          <li>The li element defines each list item</li>
          <li>The a element (anchor) links another webpage, using the href attribute to denote the URL</li>
          <li>The img element embeds an image within the page, the src attribute defines the files’ location</li>
          <li>The section element is used to group related elements together</li>
          <li>An attribute defines additional information about an element and is included within the tag ex. (html lang=”en”)</li>
          <li>Most information in the head and meta elements will be invisible to the user</li>
          <li>The title element and other metadata are important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</li>
          <li>The !DOCTYPE declaration is included at the beginning of every html file and lets the browser know which version of HTML is being used</li>
          <li>Semantic elements’ names clearly define their use</li>
          <li>Semantic elements should be favored over non-semantic ones to give greater accessibility to those with disabilities</li>
          <li>Non-semantic elements include (div) and (span) which create a page division or an inline division respectively</li>
          <li>HTML elements usually begin with a tag and end with a tag preceded by slash. The content is contained between the tags</li>
          <li>Elements nested within elements are considered "child" elements. The outer element is called the "parent"</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</li>
            <li>CSS can be implemented in 3 ways. Using inline CSS, an external style sheet in a separate file, or an internal style sheet in the head element</li>
            <li>External files can be implemented using the link element</li>
            <li>CSS rules are structured such that there is a selector, which defines which attribute to apply the rules to, and a declaration, or what rules will be applied</li>
            <li>Declarations contain a property and value component</li>
            <li>The box model defines the spacing of html elements and consists of content, padding, borders, and margins</li>
            <li>Margins are the space around the outside border of an element</li>
            <li>Padding is the space around the content inside an element</li>
            <li>The (*) symbol can be used as a selector to select all elements in the page</li>
            <li>Separating two or more selectors by a comma allows the same declarations to affect both selectors</li>
            <li>This is a strategy known as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and it reduces the amount of lines of code that are written</li>
            <li>Any HTML element assigned a class can be selected using a class selector. The classes' name preceded by a period acts as the selector</li>
            <li>Colors can be defined semantically, such as blue or green, or using hexadecimal codes such as #E57E11</li>
          </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section"> 
        <h2>Git</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Git is a system used through the command line to keep track of each iteration of your project in its development</li>
            <li>Github is a cloud based website that allows developers to store their projects remotely and allows for easier collaboration on projects</li>
            <li>Projects and their previous versions are stored in what’s known as a repository. A remote repository is stored on github that all members can access and a local repository is stored on your own computer</li>
            <li>Creating a copy of the code or a new branch allows new features to be developed, tested, and reviewed without affecting the already existing application</li>
            <li>Any changes made in the feature branches are committed, where the changes to any files are documented. The new code can then be pushed up to the remote branch</li>
            <li>A pull request can be opened to determine whether or not the new code should be merged into the main branch</li>
            <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
            <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
            <li>git add -A: Stages all changes that will be added in the next commit</li>
            <li>git commit -m message: Takes a snapshot of currently staged changes as well as sends a short message of what has been changed</li>
            <li>git pull origin branch: Takes changes from the remote branch to make sure the local branch is up to date</li>
            <li>git push origin branch: Sends local changes up to the remote repository</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>JavaScript allows user to interact with the website</li>
            <li>The script element can be used to add JavaScript to the HTML file</li>
            <li>var var-name = value; Is used to declare a variable</li>
            <li>Multiple values can be stored in a variable using square brackets with each item separated by a comma. This is called an array</li>
            <li>There are different data types that variables can store, most notably Numbers, Strings (text data), Boolean (true/false data)</li>
            <li>Different data types can be stored in the same array</li>
            <li>JavaScript executes the code from top to bottom so it matters what order your code is written in</li>
            <li>Control Flow is a tactic to manipulate in what order the code is executed</li>
            <li>For loops and If statements can be used to tell the computer to execute a different piece of code if certain conditions are met</li>
            <li>If the condition provided is deemed “truthy”, then the code will execute, otherwise it will be skipped if the condition is deemed “falsy”</li>
            <li>A value is considered falsy if it is 0, -0, 0n, ” ”, undefined, NaN, null, or false. All other values are considered truthy</li>
            <li>Multiple conditions can be written and the computer will check each condition until a truthy value is found. Then it will execute the code and break out of the loop</li>
            <li>=== is the strict equality operator and returns a boolean result</li>
            <li>For loops allow blocks of code to be executed over and over again</li>
            <li>For loops contain 3 statements</li>
            <li>A starting point for where to start the loop</li>
            <li>A condition where the code will continue to run until the condition is not met</li>
            <li>An increment that updates the variable or condition</li>
