        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML - Hypertext Markup Language</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title that is show to the user</li>

          <li>The link element defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, viewport, and description</li>
          <li>The script element embeds executable code within the document</li>
          <li>The h1 element defines a heading. h1 is the highest level of heading and h2, h3 etc. can be used to define lesser ones up to h6.</li>
          <li>The ul element defines an unordered list</li>
          <li>The ol element defines an ordered list</li>
          <li>The li element defines each list item</li>
          <li>The a element (anchor) links another webpage, using the href attribute to denote the URL</li>
          <li>The img element embeds an image within the page, the src attribute defines the files’ location</li>
          <li>The section element is used to group related elements together</li>
          <li>An attribute defines additional information about an element and is included within the tag ex. (html lang=”en”)</li>
          <li>Most information in the head and meta elements will be invisible to the user</li>
          <li>The title element and other metadata are important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</li>
          <li>The !DOCTYPE declaration is included at the beginning of every html file and lets the browser know which version of HTML is being used</li>
          <li>Semantic elements’ names clearly define their use</li>
          <li>Semantic elements should be favored over non-semantic ones to give greater accessibility to those with disabilities</li>
          <li>Non-semantic elements include (div) and (span) which create a page division or an inline division respectively</li>
          <li>HTML elements usually begin with a tag and end with a tag preceded by slash. The content is contained between the tags</li>
          <li>Elements nested within elements are considered "child" elements. The outer element is called the "parent"</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</li>
            <li>CSS can be implemented in 3 ways. Using inline CSS, an external style sheet in a separate file, or an internal style sheet in the head element</li>
            <li>External files can be implemented using the link element</li>
            <li>CSS rules are structured such that there is a selector, which defines which attribute to apply the rules to, and a declaration, or what rules will be applied</li>
            <li>Declarations contain a property and value component</li>
            <li>The box model defines the spacing of html elements and consists of content, padding, borders, and margins</li>
            <li>Margins are the space around the outside border of an element</li>
            <li>Padding is the space around the content inside an element</li>
            <li>The (*) symbol can be used as a selector to select all elements in the page</li>
            <li>Separating two or more selectors by a comma allows the same declarations to affect both selectors</li>
            <li>This is a strategy known as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and it reduces the amount of lines of code that are written</li>
            <li>Any HTML element assigned a class can be selected using a class selector. The classes' name preceded by a period acts as the selector</li>
            <li>Colors can be defined semantically, such as blue or green, or using hexadecimal codes such as #E57E11</li>
          </ul>
