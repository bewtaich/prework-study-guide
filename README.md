# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a webpage I created to kickstart my coding journey. It was a great excersize
that allowed me to research and learn about different languages and topics, while also
putting those concepts into practice. Through making this I learned a lot about HTML, 
CSS, JavaScript and Git. This also functions as a place where my notes are neatly
strcutured and organized and can help with studying and improving my skills.

## Usage

Each section contains notes about a different topic. A lot of the notes are fundamental and important to be able to understand more complex topics. You can review what ever section
you think you need to freshen up on the most or you can use the Chrome DevTools and the
console will suggest a topic for you.
